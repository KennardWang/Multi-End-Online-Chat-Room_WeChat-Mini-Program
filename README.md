### Known Bugs
1. The display of message will come back to the top if quitting the fullscreen of video.
2. If you send a text message during the time you are looking through the chat history, it will not scroll down to the bottom. Probably you can refresh it by scrolling down manually or re-entering.
3. I use default audio style sheets so that it maybe look not perfect.
